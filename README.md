# brainfuck-interpreter
A simple Brainfuck interpreter written in Java

Feel free to leave any suggestions xd.  You can run this java file, and then input the program via the CLI. Although it supports inputting the program in multiple lines, do not leave empty lines in-between lines of code.

You can also run a Brainfuck program by supplying the file's path as the program argument when running the `Brainfuck.java` file. Example;

```
java Brainfuck.java adder.b
```
